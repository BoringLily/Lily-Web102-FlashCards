                "question": "What is a computer?",
                "answer": "An electronic device for storing and processing data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program."

                "question": "Computer Architecture",
                "answer": "In computer engineering, computer architecture is a description of the structure of a computer system made from component parts. It can sometimes be a high-level description that ignores details of the implementation."

                "question": "what is RISC?",

                "question": "What is a CISC architecture?",
                "answer": "A computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions."
            },
            {
                "question": "Instruction Pipelining",
                "answer": "Instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level parallelism within a single processor."

                "question": "Logic Gate",
                "answer": "An idealized or physical device that performs a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output."
            },
            {
                "question": "What does MOSFET stand for?",
